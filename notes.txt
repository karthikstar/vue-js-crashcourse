Working with state/data 

Components can have their own state which can determine how a specific component behaves and what data is displayed

Some state may be local to a specific component and some may be "global" or "app" level state that needs to be shared with multiple components

Vuex is a state manager for global state in larger apps

Options API vs Composition API
- traditionally use options api
- vue 3 has Composition api which aims to address code reusability and redability in vue 3, especially in larger applications
